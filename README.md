# RegEx Snippets

A curated collection of practical regular expression examples for real-world tasks.

## What is this?

[`regex-snippets.com`](https://regex-snippets.com) is a repository of regex patterns you can use, adapt, and learn from. Each snippet targets a specific use case or pattern extraction. All regexes included in this repository are **tested** for correctness and practical usage.

## Methodology

Every regex is:
- Written for clarity and real-life applicability.
- Validated with sample data and edge cases relevant to the pattern.
- Accompanied by documentation to explain its intended use and potential caveats.

We aim to make regex approachable and reusable.
